Identifying Seasonal Patterns and Comparing Trends made simple

Understanding seasonal trends is critical for many analytical tasks. Platforms such as Google Trends leverage line charts to visualize trends for keywords. While line charts effectively visualize the trend over a time period, identifying seasonal patterns using line charts can be unintuitive due to the cognitive load involved. This issue is exacerbated when using Google Trends to compare the trends between multiple keywords due to the visualization approach used by the platform. To address these limitations, a concise visualization tool that seeks to minimize the mental effort required to recognize seasonal patterns and compare trends between various keywords across several years is proposed. The paper includes case studies that illustrate the practical application of CycloTrends. An evaluation study shows the merits of CycloTrends in discerning seasonal patterns and comparing trends across multiple categories.
